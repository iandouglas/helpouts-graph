          Please double check that you're uploading a provider report created by Google Helpouts.
        %li
          Try downloading a fresh copy and do not manipulate the data in the file.
        %li
          Do not convert the file to Excel format or anything but the plain CSV file Google Helpouts creates.

      %p
        If none of those steps works, please contact Ian Douglas via the Google+ link at the top of this page.
