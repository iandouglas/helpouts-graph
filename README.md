helpouts-graph
==============

Web interface for graph reporting of Google Helpouts sessions.

The intended platform will be Python, Flask, App Engine, Polymer, D3.js

I'm placing the code here on GitHub for my appspot.com project so that other Helpouts providers with an understanding of programming can see that I'm not doing anything malicious with their data.
